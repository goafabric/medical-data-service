# Scope: Spring Boot Rest + Data JPA + something with Kafka

# Success
- Typing Completion (most of the time)
- Generating programatic Demo Data
- Simple enhanced switch for KafkaListener
- Terraform, Create Docker Pull Secret
- findbyStreet Repository Method for both Spring and Quarkus (new jakarta data)


# Fail
- Creating a new Project from Scratch with latest Spring boot Version (due to training data cut off, 
  - providing doc increases spring boot version, but forgets to upgrade transient dependency
-
- Failed to generate Layers for Controller, Logic, Persistence for Entity B from Entity A
- Failed to convert Medical Record find method to findBy Example with PatientId (2 Times)
- Failed to fix ClassCast Exception for Kafka Payload (at least had an idea how to fix it)
- settings a windsurf.yaml rules file does not work out of the box in intellij, info has to be provided in the chat
  - even then the generated code (declarative restclient) is only partly correct, and overall faulty

# Bugs
- Complaining all of the time that it cannot build the project with gradle wrapper
- Often crashes Intellij, especially when opening new projects
- Declined faulty proposal changes, stop added the changes again and again and again


# Speed
- very very slow compared to online chatgpt (even if just one file is part of the changed)
