# Success

- identifying a faulty call to a rest endpoint (post vs get) which slipped through by calling an undesired method
- generation if a composable TenantAwareKafkaListener

# Fail
- Kafkalistener with Wildcard for all topics, Windsurf/Claude haluzinated, while chatgpt just said thats not possible

# Bug
- With Windsurf installed in Intellij, when writing code, the lines are constantly shifting up and down, this is like getting see sickness on a boat
